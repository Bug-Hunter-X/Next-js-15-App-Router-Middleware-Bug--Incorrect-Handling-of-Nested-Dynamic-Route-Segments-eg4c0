In Next.js 15, an uncommon bug can occur when using the `app` directory's file-based routing system in conjunction with dynamic routes and middleware.  If you have a route like `app/[...slug]/page.js` and you try to access a nested segment of the `slug` parameter inside middleware without proper validation, you might encounter unexpected behavior or errors. For instance, if a user accesses `/product/123/details`, the middleware may not correctly identify or handle the `123` and `details` segments. This can lead to incorrect responses or runtime crashes, especially if you're relying on those segments to perform database queries or other actions.
