# Next.js 15 App Router Middleware Bug: Handling Nested Dynamic Route Segments

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in Next.js 15's `app` directory when using middleware with nested dynamic route segments.  The issue arises when accessing and processing nested segments of a dynamic route parameter within middleware without proper validation or handling.

## Bug Description

The bug involves unexpected behavior or errors when attempting to access nested segments of a dynamic route parameter (e.g., `[...slug]`) within middleware.  Failure to correctly parse and validate the segments can lead to errors or incorrect behavior.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Access a route like `/product/123/details`. Observe the unexpected behavior or error in the console.

## Solution

The solution involves robust validation and handling of the nested route segments within the middleware function to ensure that they are correctly processed before being used in database queries or other actions.  This prevents errors and ensures the middleware function operates correctly in all scenarios.
